		<p>The goal of Solar Decathlon is to make an eco-friendly house that has a net energy usage of zero. Naturally, the water system in the house will play a significant role in that calculation. In our design, we incorporated up-to-date sustainable technologies and utilized other components of the house, including its location and solar features.</p> 
		<p>The Y-House, as we fondly call it, will pump water as necessary from the provided storage tank outside the house to the wet wall between the private and public areas of the house. Before entering the house, this water will be divided into two streams, one for cold water and one for hot. The cold water system will consist of a simple refrigeration pump, which will chill cold water before it enters the home environment. The hot water on the other hand will be first pumped up to the roof, where it will run under the solar panels and absorb radiated heat before entering the solar hot water system. Hot water output from this system will be stored in the hot water tank, which will sit on top of the wet wall.</p>
		<p>Additional hot water for the house’s potable water system will be generated via a solar thermal method. Specifically, the system will use a thermosiphon approach, which transports the hot water through gravity and convection and is thus ideal for conserving energy. In addition to the hot water storage tank and collector, a bypass valve and pressure temperature relief valve will be installed. The bypass valve will allow one to manually bypass this additional solar heat source, which will be a useful feature on warm sunny days when the solar panels are generating more than enough heat to heat the water on their own. The pressure temperature relief valve then moderates the temperature of water, avoiding any excess temperature rise.
		</p>
		<p>The solar hot water collector will be connected to the storage tank and placed on top of the house above the water wall. The collector will be a combination of a flat plate collector and a selective surface, which will increase the collector’s heat absorption. Because the house is designed for California’s climate, the mechanism will need to be approximately 20 square feet and produce 40 gallons of water daily, sufficient for a family of two.</p>
		<p>
		After heating or cooling, water will be directed to the pipeline manifold, which will be located inside the central wet wall. The manifold will direct hot and cold water separately through PEX piping to appliances in the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room. In addition to appliances, hot water will be directed to a radiant heating system under the public area and each bedroom, whereas cold water will be circulated through a radiant cooling system and liquid desiccant system.
