		<p>Over the summer, I participated in the Yale Entrepeneurial Institute Tech Bootcamp, going from zero coding experience to building my own websites. I studied both the technical details of the Ruby language and Rails framework as well as many design aspects, from CSS3 frameworks to wireframes to user testing. The projects I worked on ranged from small projects that assorted Youtube playlists to my full-scale final project which I presented to the Yale community, once during the Tech Bootcamp and again at the Yale Information Technology Services Summit during Fall 2014.</p>
		<p>My final project for the program was a site I had wanted to build for a while. One of the greatest issues I found on Yaleâ€™s campus is an abundance of creativity and ideas but a lack of communication between mutual interests. Either someone would have a great idea but knew no one else with the correct skills sets, or someone had a great skill set or did not know what to build.</p>
		<p>In response, my team built Y.Create, a social networking site for Yalies based around projects. On the dashboard, one can view all of his or her current projects in one convenient place. If one then decides they want to see what other projects are happening, he or she can browse through all the projects on the site or search by interest tags, catering to the individual user. If one is looking for people to join his or her projects, one can then browse through all the members of the site or by interest tags and request for others to join projects. Each project page states all the information Yalies need to get involved: description, location, even time commitment! Whether projects are big or small, we designed a site that brings the talents and ideas of Yale together, creating something simply great. The application is only accessible by Yale students, but you can visit the <a href="https://ycreate.herokuapp.com">landing page</a> and see the screenshots below.</p>
