		<p>As part of my Introduction to Engineering, Innovation, and Design class, we worked in teams to build a final project for various clients. Our client, the Peabody Museum of Natural History, requested an interactive exhibit to accompany its “Hidden Lives of Ants” exhibition, which mainly consisted of static photographs of leaf-cutter ants. After discussing further with David, our correspondent from the museum, both the team and David found an interest in how leaf-cutter ants leave chemical trails for other ants to follow, usually leading toward a new food source. We thus decided on a basic concept: allowing visitors to create lines that a robotic ant could follow.</p>
		<p>I heavily focused on the creation of the ant casing around the line-following car. I roughly modeled the proportions of the leaf-cutter ant, including its three body divisions, six legs, and monocular eyes. After several sketches and making the design friendly for younger visitors, I found a group approval in the current design. I modeled the creature in SolidWorks and 3D-printed in the Yale Center for Engineering, Innovation, and Design. The 3D product, although structurally steady, was too rough and the wrong color. After talking with the staff, I decided to send the print through a thermo-former, producing a clear, strong plastic casing of the ant. After a coat of paint and carefully filling the case with a custom piece of foam, we had our ant model.</p>

				Blueprinting 3D Ants.<br>
				In order to build the ant casing for our line-following vehicle, I modeled an ant case based on the vehicle's dimensions and the anatomy of a leaf cutter ant. Of course, a factor of cuteness was included.
