		<p>For the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition, my team worked on a novel, low-cost system for environmental control inside a rocket during normal turbulent flight. Typically, experiments during flight are limited by external forces, causing random errors, filling signals with noise, and difficult to account for in calibration. We thus decided to send an atomic clock in the rocket with a system that accounted for three variables: shock, vibration, and heat.</p>
		<p>I was a part of the Payload team, the team that directly addressed these three variables.  We approached each factor individually and researched how more advanced rockets account for these factors. After weeks of research and drafting and several meetings with professors, we finalized our payload.</p>
		<p>First, shock was managed using industrial strength springs. Thrust curves simulated in RockSim were used to calculate the maximum force the payload would experience. Then, by experimentally determining the K value of the springs, we were calculated the appropriate spring length. The payload’s control wires then transmitted data collected from the payload to Arduinos in the electronics bay. Vibrations caused by the uneven thrust of the rocket’s motor were dampened by specially chosen sorbothane pads that surround the clock. Additionally, shock is reduced by five centimeters of foam, insulating the clock from sudden vertical shocks likely upon parachute deployment and impact with the ground. Finally, the clock itself was encased in a gallium case (seen as the purple 3D-printed model here) to prevent the atomic clock from overheating. We chose gallium based on the maximum temperature point for our atomic clock and gallium’s thermal properties.</p>
