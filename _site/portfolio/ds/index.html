		<p>During Fall 2014, I interned at Digital Surgeons as a Web Development Intern. My work varied from front-end, assembling the front pages into gorgeous layouts, to back-end, making modules and APIs that processed and analyzed data. I worked alongside fellow developers in addition to marketing specialists and designers, learning many aspects of what makes a clientâ€™s brand. I even participated in company-wide meetings to brainstorm marketing and branding ideas for clients.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, a great deal of the work I have done with Digital Surgeons has not been deployed to production and made public. However, I have worked on sites for the American Kennel Club, the Human Rights Campaign, Tweed Airport in New Haven, and Formyture.</p>
		<p>The one site that is currently public is that of Nugo Nutrition. I assembled this <a href="http://www.nugonutrition.com/dark-chocolate-deception/">landing page for dark chocolate deception</a>.</p>
