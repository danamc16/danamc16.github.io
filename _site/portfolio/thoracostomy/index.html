		<p>Alongside biomedical engineers and Yale medical students, we delved into the field of thoracostomy, or the use of chest tubes in the body for the purpose of drainage. The specific problem we approached was chest tube insertion. Currently, most chest tubes are inserted directly into the body; larger chest tubes thus cause a substantial amount of trauma to the surrounding tissue. The procedure is also often done without the use of anesthesia, making it one of the most painful procedures a patient can experience. Additionally, once the chest tube is in the body, it is difficult for the doctor to direct the tube and not bump into ribs or other organs.</p>
		<p>We researched current medical equipment on the market and made clear goals: trauma reduction, pain reduction, and placement accuracy. Our current design does just that. Taking after dilator procedures and catheters, we insert a device wrapped tightly around a needle into the chest. We then remove the needle, and using the device’s expandable structure, the doctor can slide his or her finger into the device. He or she can then direct the device where he or she desires, and the device will hold its shape due to an embedded metal strip. Finally, the finger is removed, and a guide wire enters the system and is directed by the device. The device can then be removed, and the chest tube is slid along the guidewire, accurately placing the chest tube.</p>
		<p>Our low cost solution can be easily implemented with current tubes and kits in the industry and will reduce the number of wasted test tubes in hospitals, currently at 1.7 tubes per patient. More importantly, it reduces the patient’s trauma during thoracostomy procedures and gives doctor the security they need while operating on the patient.</p>
		<p>In order protect our provisional patent, no images or drafts of the product can be released until September 2015.</p>
